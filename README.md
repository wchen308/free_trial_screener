# Udacity Free Trial Screener A/B Test 
This project is to test if a free trial screener on Udacity course webpage can reduce a significant amount of students who give up in free trial period due to not enough time and increase the retention rate so that Udacity can put more attention and resource on those who can spend time on their course.
